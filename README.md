Test-task. Tags generator developed with HTML/CSS/vanilla JS.

The result file **index.html** is situated in the «**/dist**» folder. 
And all the source(pre-build) files are available in the «/src» one.

Some features, that can not be visible on the UI:
1. Tags can be added both with clicking «Add»-button and pressing Enter.
2. Adding more than one tag at a time is possible by splitting tags with a comma(«,») in the input field.
3. localStorage is used to save the current tags. in order to reset the tag generator you need to reload the page twice without making any changes.

As usual, type

«npm install
npm run build»

in the project directory if you want to rebuild the project using webpack.
